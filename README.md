# Malware Classification
## Description
The Malware Classification Project employs a combination of deep learning and machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Vision Transformer, and XGBoost, for classifying malware samples. We have implemented four distinct methods and performed a comparative analysis to gain insights into their performance.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of malware classification techniques through experimentation with various models and feature extraction methods. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of cybersecurity.

## Data Preprocessing
> [!WARNING] 
> Make sure you are doing this in Virtual Machine environment
- folder => `preprocessing/`
- file => `preprocessing/preprocessing.py`
- This program mainly do the three things
    1. label and clean the family of virus
    2. create greyscale images of virus
    3. organize all greyscale images to the family folder (dataset/folder)
- path variable => `malware_dir`: directory contains malware files
- img_dir => `img_dir`: directory to save images
